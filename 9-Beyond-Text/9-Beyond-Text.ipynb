Trillions of digital audio, image, and video files have been generated by cell phones and distributed sensors, preserved and shared through social medial, the web, private and government administrations. In this notebook, we read in and visualize audio and image files, process them to extract relevant features and measurement, then begin to explore how to analyze and extract information from them through the same approaches to supervised and unsupervised learning we have performed thoughout the quarter with text.\n",

    "First we will consider media that predates written language...sound and spoken language. Audio (and video) files come in two major categories, lossy or lossless. Lossless files save all information the microphone recorded. Lossy files, by contrast, drop sections humans are unlikely to notice. Recorded frequencies for both types are then typically compressed, which introduces further loss. To work with audio files, we want a format that is preferably lossless or minimally compressed. We will work with `wav` files here. Note that `mp3` is not acceptable. If you do not have `wav` files, we can use python to convert to `wav`."

    "The final critical parameter of sound digitization is quantisation, which consists in assigning a value to each sample according to its amplitude. These values are attributed according to a bit scale. A quantisation of 8 bit will assign amplitude values along a scale of $2^8 = 256$ states around 0. Most recording systems use a $2^{16} = 65536$ bit system. Quantisation is a rounding process, where high bit quantisation produces values close to reality with values rounded to a high number of significant digits, and low bit quantisation produces values further from reality with values rounded a low number of significants digits. Low quantisation can lead to impaired quality signal. <img src=\"data/bitrate.png\"> This figure illustrates how digital sounds is a discrete process along the amplitude scale: a 3 bit, $2^3=8$, quantization (gray bars) gives a rough approximation of the sin wave (red line)."

    "\n",
    "Recall our earlier use of scikit-learn for machine learning. Now we will use scikit-image to do some simple image processing. Here we will perform three operations for 'blob' of simple object detection. In computer vision, blob detection methods aim to detect regions in a digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, compared to surrounding regions. Informally, a blob is a region of an image in which some properties are approximately constant or similar to each other. We will do this in three ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take the Laplacian of an image, which is a 2-D isotropic (applying equally well in all directions) measure of the 2nd spatial derivative of an image. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid intensity change and is therefore often used for edge detection. This Laplacian is taken of the image once a Gaussian smoothing filter has been applied in order to reduce its sensitivity to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplacian $L(x,y)$ of an image with pixel intensity values $I(x,y)$ is given by: $L(x,y)=\\frac{\\delta^2x}{\\delta x^2} + \\frac{\\delta^2y}{\\delta y^2}$. A Gaussian smoothing filter takes a 2 dimensional Guassian, $G(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2} e^\\frac{-x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma^2}$, which looks like: <img src=\"http://www.librow.com/content/common/images/articles/article-9/2d_distribution.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This Gaussian *kernel* is applied to the pixel intensities of the image via *convolution* -- the kernel is multiplied by the pixel intensities, while centered on each pixel, then added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blob detector computes the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) images with successively increasing standard deviation and stacks them up in a cube. Blobs are local maximas within this cube. Detecting larger blobs is slower because of larger kernel sizes during convolution. Bright blobs on dark backgrounds are detected."

The Hessian matrix or Hessian is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}(x_1^{*}, \\ldots, x_n^{*})$ and is calculated on square pixel patches of the image. The determinant is the scaling factor of each patch. This approach is fastest and detects blobs by finding maximas in this matrix (of the Determinant of the Hessian of the image).

    "Modern image and video analysis is typically performed using deep learning implemented as layers of convolutional neural nets to classify scenes and to detect and label objects. To learn more about deep learning and convolutional neural networks, spend some time with Andrew Ng's excellent [tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/). Because such algorithms require substantial computing power, none of the high-quality classifiers or detectors currently available are implemented in python, although many can be called via api. The most popular open source image object detector is UC Berkeley's [*caffe*](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) library of trained and trainable neural nets written in C++. (Check out the [python api](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/pycaffe.py)). Scene classifiers can be built on top of caffe, such as MIT's [Places](http://places.csail.mit.edu). "
